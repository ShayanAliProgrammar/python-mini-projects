# Small Python Projects
These are some leisurely Python projects that make use of PyPDF, [langchain](https://langchain.com/), [Gemini Pro API](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey), and many more tools.


## Projects Specifications
The projects described here are some of the ones I completed after viewing some of [Tech With Tim's](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) YouTube videos. I also added some of my own projects and made some adjustments to the projects.

1. Quiz Game (edit: this project uses artificial intelligence)
2. Calculate the number
3. Random Equation Solver (My Concept)
4. Scissors, paper, rock
5. My Idea for a PDF Merger
6. Color Matching Mastermind
7. Using the [Gemini Pro API] (https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) for the fundamentals of blockchain (My Concept)

### Get Initiated

Let us install some packages first.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, edit the `.env.example` file after installing all the packages.

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`
2. Update the API Key.

    ```bash
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="Page Google API Key Here"
    ```

The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is available here.(https://google.com/makersuite/app/apikey).
